Twice in  the space of  five years of starvation and brutality in four Nazi concentration camps,  Lou Dunst  was herded along with other prisoners into a gas chamber to be killed. 
Once there was a malfunction in the gas jets, and the other time a guard decided that he did not want to waste precious coal so the execution was called off. 
More dead than alive,  Lou  and other prisoners at the Ebensee camp in Austria were rescued by the U.S. Army in the final days of World War II. 
Once  Lou  regained  his  health,  he  moved to Italy and in 1951 to San Diego where  he  became a successful merchant and real estate investor. 
On Sunday,  Lou  was honored for  his extensive  work in ensuring that modern youth learn the story of the Holocaust and understand the underlying moral about the destructiveness of intolerance. 
As part of  his  80th birthday party,  Lou  was praised by several Jewish organizations, Mayor Jerry Sanders, and filmmaker Steven Spielberg. He  has been interviewed in Spielberg's effort to record the personal stories of survivors and other witnesses. 
In the emotional highpoint of the day,  Lou  and  his  brother Irving, who was also captive at Ebensee, met Robert Persinger, the Army staff sergeant who led the platoon that liberated Ebensee on May 6, 1945. The three had not since each other since that day. The reunion was arranged by  his  wife, Estelle. 
``Thank you for saving our lives, God bless you,''  Lou  said as  he  and Persinger embraced, with tears in their eyes. 
Persinger, 82, of the Rockford, Ill., area said even hardened combat veterans were shocked by the stench and horror they encountered at the camp, where about 20,000 prisoners, many of them used as slave labor, were housed in filth.
