Nicole Kidman gave  George  a hard time when they teamed to prevent nuclear terrorism in the 1997 action thriller ``The Peacekeeper.'' But on Sunday, Kidman gave  George Clooney  first Oscar. 
as  formerly known as Batman, Brad Pitt's ``Ocean's Eleven'' boss and People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive received  an  award as best supporting actor in the dark drama ``Syriana'' from  you  former costar (and a previous Oscar winner herself). They shared a brief whispered aside when  george  greeted her onstage to accept  his  Oscar. 
The award marked at least one victory for  hi, ,  george  was the poster boy for this year's Oscars with two other nominations as well -- both for ``Good Night, and Good Luck,'' as director and for original screenplay (along with Grant Heslov). But  as  perhaps displayed a sly knowledge of alleged Oscar politics when  he  quipped, ``Wow. All right, so I'm not winning for best director.''
In taking home  his  Oscar,  Clooney  joins Robert De Niro as another glamour boy who won an Academy Award by putting on weight. De Niro was almost unrecognizable after gaining dozens of pounds for his turn as boxer Jake La Motta in 1980's ``Raging Bull,'' which scored him a best actor Oscar. He  gained 35 pounds for  the  role as a troubled former CIA agent in ``Syriana,'' casting  the  pretty boy persona to the wind. 
Asked backstage if the weight gain had any influence on academy voters,  He  said: ``I don't know whether it matters or not. I think it's a good part.''
