Lindsay Dee Lohan (born July 2, 1986) is an American actress, singer, songwriter, model, director and producer, whose career has included critical and popular success in her youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles that have been well-documented in the tabloids.She began her career as a child fashion model when she was three, and was later featured on the soap opera Another World for a year when she was 10. At age 11, Lohan made her motion picture debut in Disney's remake of The Parent Trap (1998), a critical and commercial success. Her next major motion picture, Disney's remake of Freaky Friday (2003), was also a critical and commercial success. With the release of Mean Girls (2004), another critical and commercial success, and Disney's Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), another commercial success, Lohan became a teen idol sensation, a household name and a frequent focus of paparazzi and tabloids. Lohan's next starring role in the romantic comedy Just My Luck (2006), received poor reviews and was a modest commercial success. Following Just My Luck, Lohan focused on smaller more mature roles in independent movies, receiving positive comments on her work, including A Prairie Home Companion (2006), Bobby (2006) and Chapter 27 (2007).After recording several songs for her movie soundtracks, Lohan signed with Casablanca Records. Lohan's debut studio album, Speak was released in December 2004 and became the first high-seller from Casablanca in several years, selling 1 million copies in the United States and peaking at number four on the Billboard 200. The album received mostly mixed reviews and was certified platinum. Her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw) was released in December 2005 and features darker material than Lohan's debut. The album received mixed reviews and was certified gold.In 2007, two driving under the influence incidents led to Lohan being put on probation, and together with three visits to rehabilitation facilities caused the loss of several movie deals. In 2008 and 2009, Lohan worked as a fashion model and launched the clothing line 6126. She resumed her acting career with TV work in 2008, and starred in the TV film Labor Pains (2009). She appeared in Robert Rodriguez's feature film Machete (2010). Between 2010 and 2013, Lohan went into rehabilitation three times, and spent much of her time entangled in legal problems stemming from misdemeanors and probation violations.
