      (born 7 January 1945), also popularly known to his supporters as Agwambo (meaning the "Mysterious One"), Tinga, Baba, RAO, and Jakom ("Chairman") is a Kenyan politician regarded as the father of democracy in Kenya owing to his pro-democracy political engagements. He was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Langata in 1992, served as Minister of Energy from 2001 to 2002 and as Minister of Roads, Public Works, and Housing from 2003 to 2005. He was the main opposition candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Following a violent post-electoral crisis,

He came in second in Kenya's 2013 presidential elections after garnering 5,340,546 votes which represented 43.28% of the total votes cast. Son of first Vice President of Kenya, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. The family's origin in Kenya's Luo tribe has been a key to their political activity.

      was elected as the presidential candidate of the ODM. He garnered significant support in the 2007 General Election. According to the electoral body at the time (the ECK), he garnered the majority of the votes in Rift Valley, Western, his native Nyanza and Coast. Kibaki on the other hand won majority votes in Nairobi (Capital), North Eastern province, Central province and Eastern province. This is available from the ECK records. Out of the 2007 elections, his party, ODM, got 99 out of 210 seats in the parliament, making the ODM the single largest party in parliament.

      disputed the results, alleging fraud by the election commission but refused to adhere to the constitutional procedure and present an election petition before the courts. Most opinion polls had speculated that

      would defeat president Kibaki. Independent international observers have since stated that the poll was marred by irregularities favouring both PNU and ODM, especially at the final vote tallying stages. Many ODM supporters across the country rioted against the announced election results.
