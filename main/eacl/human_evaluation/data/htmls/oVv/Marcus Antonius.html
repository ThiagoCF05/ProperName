       Marcus Antonius

      (January 14, 83 BC &ndash; August 1, 30 BC) was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire.

      was appointed administrator of Italy while Caesar eliminated political opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain. After Caesar's death in 44 BC,

       Antony
      </span>
      joined forces with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another of Caesar's generals, and Octavian, Caesar's nephew and adopted son, forming a three-man dictatorship known to historians as the Second Triumvirate. The Triumvirs defeated Caesar's murderers, the Liberatores, at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, and divided the government of the Republic between themselves.

      was assigned Rome's eastern provinces, including the client kingdom of Egypt, then ruled by Cleopatra VII Philopater, and was given the command in Rome's war against Parthia.

      Relations among the Triumvirs were strained as the various members sought greater political power. Civil war between

      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">

      carried on a love affair with Cleopatra, who bore him three children, further straining

      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
       Antony

      and Octavian caused a split between the remaining Triumvirs. Their ongoing hostility erupted into civil war in 31 BC, as the Roman Senate, at Octavian's direction, declared war on Cleopatra and proclaimed

      a traitor. Later that year,
